# PolymorphismActivity
PolymorphismActivity is an academic project developed for the Software Engineering II course. It demonstrates the concept of polymorphism in Java through the implementation of geometric shapes such as circles, squares, and triangles, each inheriting from a common base class and overriding methods to calculate their area and perimeter.
